        <h2>Fullstack software developer</h2>
        <p>There is a lot of things that I like to do 
            but mostly I like learning new things and at this 
            moment I want to learn as much as possible about programming</p>
        <p>Can't wait to start coding!</p>

        <h2>Logic gate</h2>
        <p>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function;
           that is, it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs
            and produces a single binary output.</p>

            Data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time
             irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.</p>
        <h2>Programming language</h2>
        <p>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce
           various kinds of output. They generally consist of instructions for a computer
            and can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.</p>
        <h2>DNS</h2>
        <p>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other
           resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various
